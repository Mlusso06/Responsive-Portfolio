        <p class="pcontent">Michael Lusso, Graduate of Austin Peay University in Clarskville, Tn with a
            BS in Manufacturing Engineering. While attending I was a (4) year participant of both Cross-country and
            Track. After graduating I began my engineering career with Trane (3-yrs), then moved on to VikingRange (6-yrs), and now
            currently with <a id="Hny" href="https://www.hennessyind.com/" target="_blank">Hennessy Industries</a>(12-yrs). I've held the
            position of Sustaining Engineering Manager for Hennessy Industries (division of <a id="fortive"
                href="https://www.fortive.com/" target="_blank"> Fortive</a>) for the last (3) years.</p>

        <p class="pcontent">Married for over (14) years and have one wonderful daughter. I
            have coached or assisted in coaching her softball team for many seasons. She will be participating in a
            Golf league this summer. I have also played softball for well over 20+ years, but have since retired. My two
            favorite hobbies now are golf and driving my Jeep in the summer.</p>

        <p class="pcontent">I am currently in the final stages of completing an adventure in Full Stack web development
            Bootcamp. I plan to use this skill to maximize and improve my company's Manufacturing processes,
            Communication, Defect tracking and Resolution, Daily management, and Sustainment. Fortive (FTV), our Head
            company who strives for inovation, encourages us to always improve our self and the processes around us. I
            feel this will be a new resource to improve not only our company, but all the other sister companies with-in
            the Fortive umbrella (FTV)</p>
        <p class="pcontent">I continue improving this web page and others in my portfoio as I complete the many
            milestones set infront
            of me while attending Vanderbilt's Coding BootCamp (completion date: June 1st, 2020.)
